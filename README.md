# Meal Planning App
## The Why :
1. My wife has tried a lot of meal planning apps, and with an autistic child it's very difficult to take the time to plan your meals, I wanted to create a simple way for my wife to be able to do that.
2. Other meal planning apps are expensive, here is a free open source one you can spin up and install on your own server.
